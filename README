Build Prerequisites
===================

  + Qt 4.8.0 or later
  + OpenCL headers
  + SQLite (including Qt plugin)

OpenCL is not required for runtime operation.



KNOWN ISSUES
============

Linux and OpenCL and nVidia and AMD
-----------------------------------

A segfault occurs on start of the program if the following conditions
are met,

  * OpenCL for AMD devices (CPU/GPU) is available
  * nVidia OpenGL driver is on path

The segfault looks like,

../../../thread/semaphore.cpp:87: sem_wait() failed
Aborted (core dumped)

with bt indicating it happens in clCreateCommandQueue()


To workaround this problem, set Mesa GL driver as preferred over
nVidia just for lung model's execution. For example, on Debian AMD64
install,

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/mesa-diverted/x86_64-linux-gnu:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ./bshouty_model
