FCTX User Documentation
=======================

Welcome
--------

Use Fast C XUnit Test as a lightweight tool for quickly generating unit tests in
C/C++. Simply include a header and start typing out your tests.
 
With FCTX you can write tests in C/C++ just like you can in other introspective
languages like Java and Python. FCTX does not require a post-processing step.
FCTX does not require registration of your functions.  Declare your test and
start writing.
