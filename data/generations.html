<html><head/><body><p>You have the option of working with a <span style=" font-weight:600;">5-generation</span> or a <span style=" font-weight:600;">15-generation</span> model. Both models represent the <span style=" text-decoration: underline;">whole</span> pulmonary circulation. Results from simulations with the 5-generation model differ from the 15-generation model only at the second or third decimal levels and are considered clinically insignificant. Iterations with the 15-generation model, obviously, take longer to complete. You can switch between 5 and 15-generations under &quot;<span style=" font-weight:600;">Options</span>&quot;.</p><p><span style=" font-weight:600;">The 5-generation model is the default</span>.</p><p><br/></p></body></html>
