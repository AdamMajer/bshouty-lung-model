<p>You have the option of working with a <b>5-generation</b> or a <b>15-generation</b> model. 
Both models represent the <u>whole</u> pulmonary circulation. Results from simulations with 
the 5-generation model differ from the 15-generation model only at the first decimal level 
and are considered clinically insignificant. Iterations with the 15-generation model, 
obviously, take longer to complete. You can switch between 5 and 15-generations 
under <b>"Options"</b>
</p>

<p>The 5-generation model is the default.
