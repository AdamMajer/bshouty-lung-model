<p>You have the option of simulating any single disease (or combination thereof).
However, Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and Pulmonary Venous Occlusive Disease (PVOD)
have already been predefined. As mentioned before, when simulating PAH, the pathology is in the
<b>pre-capillary</b> vessels (generation 5 in the
5-generation model or generations 13-15 in the 15-generation model).
When simulating PVOD, the pathology is in the
<b>post-capillary</b> vessels
(generation 5 in the 5-generation model or generations 13-15 in the 15-generation model).</p>

<p>Diseases can be selected/deselected and/or defined/redefined under
the "Disease" menu in the Main Window. Diseases are defined using
standard ECMAScript also known as Javascript.  </p><p>Predefined diseases included with the model are:</p><p>"PAH Diffuse" and "PVOD Diffuse".  </p><p>In this case, the disease is assumed to be diffuse throughout the appropriate generation.  </p><p>Selecting "PAH - Right Lung" or "PVOD - Right Lung" in a "Double Lung" model causes diseases to be diffuse in the right lung leaving the left lung normal.  </p><p>The opposite is true for "PAH - Left Lung" and "PVOD - Left Lung".  </p><p>Selecting "PAH - Right Lung" or "PVOD - Right Lung" in a "Single" lung model causes disease in the "Lower" half of the lung leaving the "Upper" half normal.  </p><p>The opposite is true for the "Left Lung".</p>
