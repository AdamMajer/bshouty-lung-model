<p>You have the option of simulating any disease (or combination thereof). 
However, Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and Pulmonary Venous Occlusive Disease (PVOD) 
have already been predefined. When simulating PAH, the pathology is in the 
<b>pre-capillary</b> vessels (generation 5 in the 
5-generation model or generations 13-15 in the 15-generation model). 
When simulating PVOD, the pathology is in the 
<b>post-capillary</b> vessels 
(generation 5 in the 5-generation model or generations 13-15 in the 15-generation model).</p>

<p>Diseases can also be (de-)selected and/or (re)defined under 
the Disease menu in the Main Window. Diseases are defined using 
standard ECMAScript also known as Javascript.</p>
