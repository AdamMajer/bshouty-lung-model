<p>You have the option of working with a <b>single lung model</b> or a
<b>double lung model</b>.  In either case, both models represent the
whole pulmonary circulation.  This is based on model calibration with
the following targets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subject is 175 cm high and weighs 75 kg</li>
  <li>Lung height is 20 cm with normal lung compliance</li>
  <li>Measurements are performed at end-expiration (Ppl=-5 and Pal=0 cmH2O)</li>
  <li>Target PAPm is 15 mmHg at a CO of 6.45 and LAP of 5 mmHg</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to calibrate the model to represent a single lung, for
the same size subject, you will have to enter a new target PAPm for a
given CO and LAP.</p>

<p>You can re-calibrate the model at any time to represent different
physiological and/or pathological situations.</p>

<p>To simulate any situation whether normal or pathological in an
adult patient, you can just accept the default calibration (which is
stored in a database file) or recalibrate the model.  The last
calibration used is the one that is stored and used with subsequent
runs of the model.</p>

<p>The calibration factors can be reset to the default ones at any
time from the Calibration window.</p>

<p>Calibration feature is accessible under the <b>"Window"</b> menu
option.</p>
