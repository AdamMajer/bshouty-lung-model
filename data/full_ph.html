<p>You have the option of working with a "normal" pulmonary circulation model
(<b>"Standard Model"</b>).  You will be able to modify any parameter (controlling vessel characteristics) within any
single vessel (artery, vein, or capillary) or group of vessels. The <b>"Standard Model"</b>
option allows you to simulate any scenario within the pulmonary circulation,
whether clinically sound or not. In addition, the model can be used to simulate
any physiological or physiopathological. In addition, the provided model includes two
predefined scenarios simulating Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and Pulmonary
Venous Occlusive Disease (PVOD). By selecting <b>"PH Model"</b>, you will have the option
of selecting either of these diseases.
</p>

<p>Disease models can also be selected/deselected under the "Disease"
menu option in the main window.
</p>

<p>Because of the large number of vessels, some vessels may not be apparent on the
first screen. To see individual vessels and their characteristics you can zoom in
and out using either the <b>"Mouse Wheel</b> in combination with the <b>"Ctrl"</b> button
or by using the <b>"+/-"</b> button on the keyboard.
</p>

<p>To modify any vessel characteristics, double click on the vessel. A window pops
up with the parameters that can be modified.</p>

<p>To run the model, press the <b>"Calculate..."</b> button at the bottom of the sidebar on the right.</p>
