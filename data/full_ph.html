<p>You have the option of working with a normal pulmonary circulation model 
(<b>"Standard Mode"</b>), which allows you to modify any parameter within any 
single vessel/capillary or group of vessels. The <b>"Standard Model"</b>
option allows you to simulate any scenario within the pulmonary circulation, 
whether clinically relevant or not. In addition, the model can be used to simulate 
any pathological or physiological condition. The provided model includes two 
predefined scenarios simulating Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Pulmonary 
Venous Occlusive Disease. By selecting <b>"PH Mode"</b>, you will have the option 
of selecting either of these diseases.
</p>

<p>Disease models can also be (de-)selected under the Disease 
menu option in the main window.
</p>

<p>Because of the large number of vessels, some vessels may not be apparent on the 
first screen. To see individual vessels and their characteristics you can zoom in 
and out using either the <b>"Mouse Wheel</b> in combination with the <b>"Ctrl"</b> button 
or by using the "+/-" button on the keyboard.
</p>

<p>To modify any vessel characteristics, double click on the vessel. A window pops 
up with the parameters that can be modified.</p>

<p>To run the model, press the <b>"Calculate..."</b> button.</p>
