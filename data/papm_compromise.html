<p>You have the option of calculating either mean pulmonary artery pressure 
(<b>PAP<sub>m</sub></b>) for a given level of vascular compromise or calculating vascular 
compromise for a given <b>PAP<sub>m</sub></b>. In either case, the disease/pathology is 
assumed to be equally distributed across all the affected  vessels 
(generation 5 in the 5-generation model or generations 13-15 in the 15-generation model).
</p>

<p>In PAH, the pathology is in the pre-capillary vessels and in PVOD, it is the post-capillary 
vessels that are affected.</p>
