<p>You have the option of calculating either mean pulmonary artery pressure
(<b>PAP<sub>m</sub></b>) for a given level of <b>"Vascular Compromise"</b> or calculating <b>"Vascular
Compromise"</b> for a given <b>PAP<sub>m</sub></b>. In either case, the disease/pathology is
assumed to be equally distributed across all the affected  vessels
(generation 5 in the 5-generation model or generations 13-15 in the 15-generation model).
</p>

<p>In <b>PAH</b>, the pathology is in the <b>"pre-capillary"</b> vessels and in <b>PVOD</b>, it is the <b>"post-capillary"</b>
vessels that are affected.</p>
