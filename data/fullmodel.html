You have the option of running the program for a single set of input variables 
or for a range of input variables. The latter option is usually used to generate 
data for graphing.

<p>
In the sidebar (Input Model Parameters), single variables can be entered 
directly. To enter a range, right click on the input variable and select 
<b>"Set Range"</b>. A popup window allows you to set minimum, maximum and step 
values. The sequence of values that will be used in the calculations is 
immediately shown. To reset a range value back to a single value modify the 
minimum and/or maximum such as the range only contains a single 
value (minmum = maximum).
