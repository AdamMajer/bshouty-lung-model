You can run the program for a "single" set or a "range" of input variables. The latter option is usually used to generate
data for graphing.

<p>
In the sidebar ("Model Parameters") under "INPUT" in blue, single variables can be entered
directly. To enter a range, right click on the input variable and select
<b>"Set Range"</b>. A popup window allows you to set "Minimum", "Maximum" and "Step"
values. It is best to set the maximum value first, followed by the minimum value and finally the step value.  The sequence of values used in the calculations is
immediately shown. To reset a range value back to a single value modify the
minimum and/or maximum value to the same value (minmum = maximum).
